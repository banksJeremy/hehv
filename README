Need something to make in clojure to get a clue how to use it.

Hmm. I think I'll do some sort of simulation with evolution. Maybe have little
creatures running around an environment, gathering resources, reproducing
(asexually) and maybe fighting. Have a GUI, but work without it.

Display out the mean/stdev of each gene in the population to show genetic
diversity. What genes could I have?
- Fear of other individuals.
- Attraction of resources.
- Point at which it likes to reproduce.
  - Based on "health". It splits into two individuals each with half of the
    health and genes that diverge oppositely.
