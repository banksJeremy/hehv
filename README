Need something to make in clojure to get a clue how to use it.

Hmm. I think I'll do some sort of simulation with evolution. Maybe have little
creatures running around an environment, gathering res, reproducing
(asexually) and maybe fighting. Have a GUI, but work without it.

Display out the mean/stdev of each gene in the population to show genetic
diversity. What genes could I have?
- TODO: Idiomatic agents and such, no manual thread crap.
- :determination - How much is is attracted to food relative to .5 avoidance
  of other individuals.
- :speed, which results in an energy expenditure of :speed squared.
- :spawn-at-life
  - Based on "life". It splits into two individuals each with half of the
    life and genes that diverge oppositely.
